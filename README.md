This was my second project using SFML.
In this game the player is tasked to pick up randomly spawning balls to get as much points as he can.

There are 3 types of balls: 
- Regular balls that give points;
- Red balls with a white outline that damage the player;
- Green balls with a white outline that heal the player.

This project was created to further improve my c++ skills and to get used to the SFML library.
With this project I learned how to further use the rand operations within my games and how to use an enum to 
diferentiate what type of balls there is in the game and with what probability they should spawn in the game.
